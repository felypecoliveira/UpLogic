# 🧠 Logic Challenges Collection

This repository is a personal collection of **logic and programming challenges** that I've solved across multiple platforms. It serves both as a record of my progress and a resource for anyone interested in practicing problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

## 💡 What’s Inside

You’ll find solutions to challenges from platforms such as:

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [URI / Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/)
- [Exercism](https://exercism.io/)
- And others

Each folder is named according to the platform and may include:

- The problem statement (if allowed by the platform’s terms)
- My solution code
- Brief comments or explanations

## 🚀 Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills
- Explore different programming paradigms and techniques
- Practice writing clean, efficient, and readable code
- Track personal growth and patterns in logical reasoning

## 🛠️ Languages Used

Depending on the platform and challenge, I’ve used:

- Python 🐍
- C++


> Note: File and folder naming may evolve over time as I improve the organization.

## 📈 Progress

This is a growing repository. I regularly add new problems as I solve them.

## 🤝 Contributions

This is a personal repository, but feel free to explore or suggest improvements.
